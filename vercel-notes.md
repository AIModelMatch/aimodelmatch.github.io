# Transitioning to Vercel

## Key Differences

When moving this portfolio to Vercel for professional projects:

1. **Project Structure**
   - Consider using Next.js for improved SEO and performance
   - Organize by components rather than pages
   - Use `/public` folder for static assets

2. **Image Handling**
   - Use Next/Image component for automatic optimization
   - Store larger image libraries in cloud storage (AWS S3, Cloudinary)
   - Implement responsive images for various devices

3. **Content Management**
   - Consider a headless CMS (Contentful, Sanity, Strapi)
   - Use markdown files with frontmatter for simpler projects
   - Implement dynamic routing for content pages

4. **Deployment**
   - Connect GitHub repository to Vercel
   - Set up automatic deployments on push
   - Configure environment variables for API keys
   - Use preview deployments for client review

5. **Performance Enhancements**
   - Server-side rendering for dynamic content
   - Static generation for fixed pages
   - API routes for server functions without separate backend
   - Edge functions for location-specific customization

This portfolio site serves as a demonstration of design and coding skills.
For client projects, the Vercel setup would provide enhanced capabilities for content updates and media management.
